abstract: "We present a novel methodological framework for conducting digital scholarship in the humanities. Our approach integrates computational analysis with traditional interpretive methods, enabling researchers to analyze large-scale cultural datasets while maintaining critical engagement with individual texts. Through case studies in literary analysis and historical research, we demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and broad applicability across humanities disciplines."

## Presentation

This paper was presented at the International Conference on Digital Humanities (ICDH 2023) in Toronto, Canada.

## Methodology

Our framework consists of three key components:

1. Computational text analysis
2. Interpretive close reading
3. Integrated synthesis

## Applications

We demonstrated the framework through applications in:
- 19th-century literary analysis
- Historical newspaper archives
- Cultural heritage collections
