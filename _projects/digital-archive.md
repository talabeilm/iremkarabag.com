## Project Overview

This multi-year project aims to digitize and make accessible a collection of over 10,000 historical manuscripts from the 18th century. Beyond simple digitization, we are developing advanced computational tools for:

- Automated transcription using machine learning
- Named entity recognition and linking
- Network analysis of historical correspondence
- Interactive visualization of temporal and geographical data

## Methodology

Our approach combines traditional archival methods with cutting-edge digital humanities techniques:

1. **Digitization**: High-resolution imaging of manuscripts
2. **Metadata Creation**: Comprehensive cataloging following TEI standards
3. **Computational Analysis**: ML-based transcription and analysis
4. **Public Access**: Web-based interface for researchers and public

## Current Progress

- ✅ Phase 1: Digitization complete (3,500 manuscripts)
- 🔄 Phase 2: Transcription and metadata (in progress)
- ⏳ Phase 3: Analysis tools (planned for 2025)
- ⏳ Phase 4: Public launch (planned for 2026)

## Impact

This project will provide unprecedented access to historical materials and serve as a model for similar digital archive initiatives. We are collaborating with libraries and archives internationally to share our methodologies and tools.

## Publications

This project has resulted in several publications:

- Smith, J., & Your Name (2024). "Automated Transcription of Historical Manuscripts." *Digital Humanities Quarterly*
- Your Name et al. (2023). "Building Sustainable Digital Archives." *DHQ*
